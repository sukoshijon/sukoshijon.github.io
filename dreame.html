        <h2>Dream Encyclopaedia - Released 2019/01/15</h2>
        <p class="albumdesc">
            Dream Encyclopaedia is an electronica/synthwave EP I recorded in 2018 with the aim of releasing it as a much larger album, titled "Dream Library". I think the name was a pun or something. <br>
            <br>
            Of course, it's fairly obvious that this is <i>not</i> the large album I was originally intending to release. That's because said album lost direction, turning into way too many different ideas and genres, and I didn't like 75% of the music on there. So I took 6 tracks from it and released those as an EP with the intention of following it up with a full album in the style of those tracks. (give me a few months for that one)<br>
            So, what's on the EP?<br>
            <br>
            <b>Look to the Stars</b> was inspired by a space exploration game which I cannot remember the name of. All I remember is, I played that game and I was thinking of this song. <br>
            Those of you with ridiculously powerful hearing will probably notice the fact that the FM synth lead that plays at the beginning of the song is not the one that comes back halfway through. The lead in that section was actually the original. The one in the opening was recorded on my (at the time) brand new Yamaha Reface CS, and since I'm not that great at staying in time, none of the recordings I did for the middle section were.. in time.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Evergreen</b> was the first song I wrote for this EP. It was written before I even had the idea to do the Dream Library album, as at the time I was working on some space/sci-fi/war-of-the-worlds-but-edm concept album. I wrote it for a friend's speeddraw video, and in my head I thought "yeah i should do more of this".<br>
            <br>
            <b>Resentful</b> marks the beginning of two songs who's names I will never explain the meaning behind. It's a weird song because if you were to say "he picked those chords by firing darts at the circle of fifths" then you wouldn't be far off. I have no idea what I was doing. This track also makes use of some more interesting percussion compared to the drummachines of the other tracks, using chopped up samples of a random drum loop that I found. I'm not sure why I did that either.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Tea</b> is simultaneously my favourite and least favourite track on this EP. It's not named after the drink, or the northern way of saying dinner. But, I can tell you that it was butchered by my awful keyboard playing skills. The original version of this track was entirely sequenced, but me being the idiot I am, I lost the original project files (I later found a mastering file which I will be including as a bonus on Dream Library, don't worry). I must have rerecorded the main pad thing on 4 different synthesizers, ranging from software to hardware analog to virtual analog to this terrible old organ I had lying around. What I eventually released wasn't exactly bad, but I still prefer the original version for some reason.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Penne</b> is the only song here who's name is just pure randomness, because unlike both versions of Dream Library (which had/have some fairly random titles), most of the titles here have some assignable meaning. With this track, the only thing I can say about the name is the preset name for the FM lead is called "pasta lead". I have no idea why I called it that.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Final Day</b> is to me what Megalovania is to Toby Fox, minus the meme. I put this song in literally everything. It was originally written for a sample manipulation challenge, but then I did a "remaster" of it a few months later. Then I put it on this EP, and it's on the track listing for Dream Library too, and I have a piano arrangement of it somewhere and it's probably going to be in my game project/idea which I haven't properly announced yet. Point is, it's everywhere.<br>
